Output and Report
=================

The output files are stored in the ``results/`` folder in the directory where the workflow was executed. 
The nextflow log file for the execution of the pipeline can be found in the directory of execution. 

LMAS creates an interactive HTML report, stored in the ``report/`` folder in the directory where the workflow 
was executed. To open the report simply click oh the ``index.html`` file and the report will open on your default browser.

An example of the resulting report is available at https://lmas-demo.herokuapp.com.
